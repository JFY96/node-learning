Webpage of a store of products, built using Node.js and the express framework.

This application is built on top of app_v3 and uses Mongoose instead of MongoDB native.

Technologies used:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS Templating Language
- Mongoose for MongoDB

There are node module dependencies which will require installing for the app to function (node_modules set to be ignored by git).

Also requires a ``config.json`` used for database details in the root directory (Check ``config-TEMPLATE.json``).
